# Welcome to Geoguessr Lite! 
 
Welcome to Geoguessr Lite! You will be dropped into a random location in the world and must deduce where you are based on unique observations like key landmarks, license plates, native grass species, road widths, sun positions, and basically anything else that you can possibly think of. 

With this addicting competitive game, we aim to provide an educational platform for users on the different cultures and countries that exist around the world. By visiting all 7 continents online with the touch of a button, we hope to inspire curious users to pursue an adventure to a new place in real life.

Want to see the game in action? Click [here](./another-page.html)!


## Some of the Unique features include: 

*   You can zoom into the map & each countries’ states/provinces/cities are named by their official language. Clicking on the map gives you a pop-up for the latitude and longitude of your guess. You can pin your guess with a marker and also see the correct location. 

*   The images for each round are generated randomly.

*   The scoreboard measures the distance between your guess and the actual location of the image, the number of points you receive based on the accuracy of your guess, and your average score across all rounds. 

*   The textbox is where you can input your guess latitude and longitude. Use the “Confirm Guess” button to lock in your guess, and the “Next Round” button to move onto the next question.
